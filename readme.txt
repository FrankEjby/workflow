2. **Transcription**
   - Using Transkribus for AI-assisted paleographic transcription
   - Training custom HTR models
   - Quality control and verification

3. **Data Structuring**
   - Creating structured database schema
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Implementing Linked Open Data standards

4. **Analysis**
   - Network analysis of book ownership
   - Text mining for subject patterns
   - Quantitative analysis of collection composition

5. **Visualization & Dissemination**
   - Interactive visualizations
   - SPARQL query development
   - Public data sharing

## Case Study
This workflow has been implemented on the library of Juan Jos√© de Austria (1629-1679).
See implementation: https://github.com/FrankEjby/library_jja

## Pedagogical Applications
This workflow can be adapted for:
- Graduate student DH training
- Course assignments on digital methods
- Individual research projects on historical collections

## Tools & Technologies
- Transkribus (transcription)
- Excel/CSV (initial data structuring)
- Python (data cleaning and analysis)
- RDF/Turtle (Linked Open Data)
- SPARQL (semantic queries)
- JavaScript/HTML (visualization)
